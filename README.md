# vite-lingui

Example of how [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/) can co-exist using [vite-plugin-babel-macros](https://github.com/itsMapleLeaf/vite-plugin-babel-macros).

The performance impact of this approach needs to be investigated, but it seems pretty fast. ðŸ”Ž

One limitation is that the message catalogs is not compiled during the vite development process, which is normally considered best practice by using webpack loaders or a [snowpack plugin](https://lingui.js.org/ref/snowpack-plugin.html). 

This is an alternative to the solution suggested in https://github.com/capaj/vite-lingui-poc

To test it out:

```sh
yarn # install dependencies
yarn dev # starts the vite dev server (port is listed)
yarn build # production build
```
