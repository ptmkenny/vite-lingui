# vite-lingui

Example of how [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/) can co-exist.

There is a performance impact of using babel macros, but currently I haven't found any alternative. ðŸ”Ž

One limitation is that the message catalogs is not compiled during the vite development process, which is normally considered best practice by using webpack loaders or a [snowpack plugin](https://lingui.js.org/ref/snowpack-plugin.html).

This is an alternative to the rather complex solution suggested in https://github.com/capaj/vite-lingui-poc

To test it out:

```sh
yarn # install dependencies
yarn dev # starts the vite dev server (port is listed)
yarn build # production build
```
